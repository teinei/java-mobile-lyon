00:00:03,173 --> 00:00:11,350
Hi, in this video, we will learn how to
put an app on the Android Play Store.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,490
So it means that your app will be
available for smartphones that

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:22,472
work with Android, so
you have Samsung phones,

4
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:28,700
Nexus, Sony phones, Motorola, I guess.

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,090
You have I would say, dozens of brands.

6
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,010
I said Samsung, I think.

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,958
You have dozens of brands that
use Android, so you will be able,

8
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:47,370
with this tutorial,
to put your app on the Android store.

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,620
So anybody with their phone,

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,661
will be able to find your app and
install it on their phone.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,430
For free, or for a price, you decide.

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,020
So this is this app that we're gonna
put on the store, so it's my CV,

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,780
you know the CV we created at
the beginning of the course.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,170
The CV is actually empty, it's just.

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,540
If we click on the button nothing happens,
but

16
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,580
that's just to make a demonstration
of how to put things online.

17
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,680
So, to do that we switch back to NetBeans
and we will do that in two steps.

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:38,300
First we need to create a certificate for
your app, it takes two seconds.

19
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,980
And then we.

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,360
It's more than two steps.

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,780
And then we create the app
with code name one.

22
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,550
And finally we can put it in the store,
in the app store.

23
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,140
So it's three steps.

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,160
Let's start by generating
a certificate for your app.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,780
So you select the title of your app.

26
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,670
You right click on it and
you go at the bottom to properties.

27
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,370
In properties, you have something
that says unrated so you click on it.

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,760
Here, here that should be empty for you.

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,216
And the reason that there's
already something here,

30
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:25,960
is that I've already
created a certificate.

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,600
To do that, I just clicked on generate,
so please do the same.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,590
And, so this line should be filled.

33
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,770
There should be something here by default.

34
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,060
This is where your
certificate will be created.

35
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,470
That's where on your computer,
where the certificate will be created.

36
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,480
So you leave it as it is.

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,860
You choose a password here
by experience I think

38
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,900
you should not use dollar
signs in your password.

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm not entirely sure but I think I had
some issues when I used dollar signs.

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,330
So use a password without this sign.

41
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,630
I'm gonna use.

42
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,157
Okay, so you do that,
and then as an alias you

43
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:33,088
choose something that, like a nickname, so

44
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:38,668
I usually take the nickname
of my Twitter account,

45
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:43,010
or my Skype account, and that's it.

46
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,090
The rest you can leave empty.

47
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,910
So it's really easy,
just a password and a name.

48
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,970
And then you click on Generate.

49
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,110
And when you do that,
you should have these things stored here.

50
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,700
You click on OK.

51
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,870
And that's it.

52
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,660
You have made a certificate for your app.

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,370
So then, you can right click on your,
on the name of your project.

54
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:22,220
Then you go to Codename One,
and Send Android Build.

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,050
When you do that, so
you need an Internet connection, but

56
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,840
if you watch this,
that should be the case.

57
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,850
The app in NetBeans will be sent
to Codename One, the website.

58
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,780
And they will create an Android app for
you.

59
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,150
So you should have created
an account with Codename One, but

60
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,390
we have seen that in previous tutorials.

61
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,220
So you just do that.

62
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,770
And that's it.

63
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,490
You know that things worked well
when you have this green line that

64
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,750
says build successful.

65
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,890
So now what you should do
is go to Codename One.

66
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,090
It's here.

67
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,349
You log in, you go to the dashboard,

68
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:21,640
and in the dashboard, you should see this.

69
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,666
So I have three lines because
I've created my app for

70
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:33,420
Apple, for Windows, and now in this
tutorial I show you for Android.

71
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,820
When it's blue, it means that it's not
finished yet, so you have to wait.

72
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,688
When it turns green, it means it's
finished, so you click on it,

73
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:47,140
and this is your app here.

74
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,970
So you download it somewhere.

75
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,830
I'm gonna put it on my desktop.

76
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,440
So it's a very long name and
it should finish with APK.

77
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,730
And you save it.

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,170
And so you have your Android
app on your computer.

79
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,170
The next step is to, so let me.

80
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,170
Let me show you.

81
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,310
The next step is to put
it on the Play Store.

82
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,237
So you Google,

83
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:37,450
Google Play Console.

84
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:43,620
And here or you can Google Play
developer that's better.

85
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,360
And here you should have, I mean if you
don't have a Google developer account yet,

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,040
you should create one and
it's going to cost you $20.

87
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,780
That's the cost that you have to pay.

88
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,815
It's just one fee, one time fee,
and with that you can put as many

89
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:07,260
apps as you want on the play store,
so it's kind of cheap.

90
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,508
Once you have a Google developer account,

91
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:17,880
you can go on the Google Play
Developer Console, which I do now.

92
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,299
You login, you are asked for
your password,

93
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:27,434
and when you do that, you arrive at

94
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:32,440
the place where all your apps are listed.

95
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,220
So in this case, I have a couple of
apps that I use to test this course.

96
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,153
To put your new app, the app that
you have created with Codename One,

97
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:48,380
you just click on Add New Application.

98
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,720
You should give it a title.

99
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:59,376
So 30 characters max and

100
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:04,324
I know that it's

101
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:10,340
slightly too long.

102
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,480
So I'm gonna put this.

103
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,630
C Levelois CV for CODAPPS.

104
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:24,790
And here you easily want to immediately
upload your file, the file off your app.

105
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,420
And then you will put all
the details of the app.

106
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,480
Or you can stand by all the details
we'll just do that, it's the same.

107
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,460
Okay, so this is the name of your app.

108
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,020
Choose your name carefully
because that's the one that

109
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,399
will appear on the Play Store.

110
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,670
It's actually quite ugly, C Levelois so I
should delete my app and create a new one.

111
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,186
I don't need to delete, sorry, no,

112
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:59,970
I can change change it here,
so I'm gonna put, anyway.

113
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,050
It should be unique because
everybody will create their CVs.

114
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:09,770
So put your name, maybe I'll just do that.

115
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,520
And I delete that.

116
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,996
Then you should fill everything
that has the little star,

117
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:20,470
so you should write something here.

118
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,420
I'm gonna be quick so
I'm gonna just write rubbish.

119
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,260
And then a full description
that should be a bit longer.

120
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,100
And so this part is the part
where you spend most time.

121
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,650
You are obliged to take
screen shots from your app or

122
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,361
actually any graphics,

123
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:57,800
because these pictures
will be on the Play Store.

124
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,612
You know when you find an app
on the store, the app store,

125
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:04,730
you have pictures to describe the app.

126
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,670
Well, this is where you put the pictures.

127
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,990
So you should have them ready to,
and as you see it's kind of boring.

128
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,810
You have to have these
very precise sizes and

129
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,955
attribute PNG file.

130
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:26,825
So here, little star

131
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:31,775
means you have to provide this
picture in this format exactly.

132
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:37,850
And you should provide this
icon as well in this format.

133
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,320
This one you are not obliged to.

134
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,180
This one you don't have to,
but you have, so

135
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,730
if you don't have them ready you just save
the draft of your app then you go out of

136
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,710
here and
you use a software to resize pictures.

137
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,910
And you prepare your pictures, and
then you come back and you put them here.

138
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,690
Then you select the type
of your application.

139
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,410
So CV's an application, not a game.

140
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,000
You choose a category,
try to be as precise as possible.

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,850
A CV's about communication maybe or
education.

142
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,590
Oh yeah, let's say it's communication.

143
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,645
Content rating is for everyone hopefully.

144
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,580
[COUGH]
And

145
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,000
what is new is that you should,
when you click here, let's do that.

146
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,650
Oh, no, I should save first.

147
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,740
So saving is on top.

148
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,620
And then you should fill
in a long questionnaire

149
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,800
on the content of your app.

150
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,110
Is it suitable for children?

151
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,818
Does it contain any violence or

152
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:03,350
things that need to be rated?

153
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,340
Where do I do that?

154
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,170
Should be here, right?

155
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,800
Oh, no, that's gonna be there.

156
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,283
So website, email,
your email is gonna be public, so

157
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:20,800
choose an email that
you are okay to share.

158
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,560
You don't need to submit
a privacy policy and then save.

159
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,510
Right, and
this thing did not turn to green.

160
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,340
It's gonna be green when we will
have done everything on this page.

161
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,180
So we did not provide pictures,
so it's not green yet.

162
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,090
APK is where, so
that's the menu here, right?

163
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,590
APK is where you upload the file
you created with Codename One.

164
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,220
Where was it?

165
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,060
So it's somewhere I have, yeah this one.

166
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,470
Whoops, sweet.

167
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:17,010
So you upload your app here.

168
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,140
That's very nice.

169
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,240
It tells you depending on how complex
your app is, maybe it can't run on

170
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,070
very old phones if, for
example, you use a map.

171
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,710
In your phone was a GPS, and you had
very old phones that don't have GPS.

172
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,195
So, in this case, they will tell you
that you have a number of phones

173
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:44,610
that will not be able to run your app,
but you know, that's okay.

174
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,200
Okay, so you just uploaded your file.

175
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,440
You need to complete that.

176
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,010
You need to do the content rating form.

177
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,870
Where you explain whether your app
contains violence, sex, and the rest.

178
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,450
Pricing.

179
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,340
That's where you would be able to say

180
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,860
if you want your app to be free or
if you want to be paid.

181
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,920
In app products, wow.

182
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,690
That's a bit specific and
I'll let you explore that and the rest.

183
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,870
But basically when you have these
four things ticked in green,

184
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,020
you will be able to select publish app.

185
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,950
And then it's a matter of hours,
like three hours before it appears on

186
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:41,090
the Play Store and on anybody's phone
on the planet that has Android.

187
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,170
So it's quite amazing.

188
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,270
I leave you with that.

189
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,910
I just want to finish by
saying that an error I made

190
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:56,040
when I created my first apps,
was that here install listing.

191
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,950
You know, for the pictures.

192
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,780
I used pictures that I found on Internet,
and

193
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,518
I didn't have a license for
them, which is bad.

194
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:11,460
And basically, Google will check that.

195
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,910
So they will, I think they have humans who
check the whatever you put in your app.

196
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,580
And if it's not something that you own,
they will reject your app.

197
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,790
They won't publish it.

198
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,450
So what you should do is use
pictures that have a license.

199
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:35,470
That allow you to use them.

200
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,100
Yeah, just use things that
you are authorized to use.

201
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,610
They actually check for that.

202
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,890
And even a casual picture
of anything you choose on

203
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:53,300
the Internet can be rejected if
you don't own the rights for it.

204
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,500
But that's basically it,
so it's so simple.

205
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,670
The most boring thing is
really to create the,

206
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,460
the most boring thing is to get the
pictures the correct size and whatever.

207
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,880
So you spend a bit of time on that.

208
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,270
It's boring.

209
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:17,500
But when you think of it, that's what will
illustrate your app on the Play Store,

210
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,530
so you should pick nice
screenshots of your app.

211
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,640
You could use the simulator,
let me switch back to the designer.

212
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,500
You can use the simulate
device function to

213
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,090
actually take screenshots of your app.

214
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,167
You know, you just open that and

215
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:46,207
then you do a print screen or
alt print screen and

216
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:51,492
that's gonna upload a print screen, and

217
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:56,777
that's going to make a screenshot of your

218
00:16:56,777 --> 00:17:02,220
phone that you can then
use to upload here.

219
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,680
Maybe you have to resize it a bit.

220
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,970
Okay, I stop there but that's super easy
to put your app on the Play Store, thanks.
