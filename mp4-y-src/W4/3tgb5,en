00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:06,847
Hi, and welcome to this video,

2
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:12,091
where we will learn how to put
your app that you see here,

3
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:17,559
onto your iPhone to visualize it,
to visualize your app,

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,830
to test it and
to see if you're happy with it.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,878
This tutorial will have a couple of steps,
actually many of them.

6
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:33,520
Each of the steps are quite simple and
we should be good to go in 20 minutes.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,680
If this video seems a bit long to you,

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,799
you should remember that all
the steps are summarized

9
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,945
in a PDF document where you can and
go at your own pace.

10
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:51,005
And maybe quicker than on this video.

11
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:54,695
But here is how I will do.

12
00:00:54,695 --> 00:01:01,825
So the first ingredient that you need
in order to install your app on your

13
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:08,125
iPhone is to have a QR
code reader on your phone.

14
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:13,855
This is an app that you can find for
free on the App Store.

15
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:17,012
So you see it here.

16
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:21,112
Oops, just there.

17
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:27,270
It's an app that enables
your phone to scan QR codes.

18
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,170
Anywhere.

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,730
So you need that on your phone.

20
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,210
The second thing thing that you need
is that your phone should be connected

21
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,040
somehow to Internet because we will
download the app to your phone.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,560
Okay, what you need next is
an account with Codename One.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,880
And let me go back to
Codename One is actually

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,300
a plug-in that we have
used to create this app.

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,980
You see the name origin here.

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,910
So Codename One is the company
that develops this thing and

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,860
we need to have an account with them,
a free account,

28
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,650
because we will send our
app to their website.

29
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,267
So I just type Codename One in Google.

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,230
And their website is the first result.

31
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,050
So I just click there.

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,270
This is a website, and you need to
sign up to have an account with them.

33
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,500
If you all ready have one,
of course don't do that again.

34
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,130
So you just put your email, your password.

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,010
You choose the free subscription.

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,436
And you join the mailing list on that.

37
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:55,100
So please fill in this form and
write down or don't forget your email and

38
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,370
password because we need,
we need them right now.

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,180
So then we go back to NetBeans.

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,601
This is your app project,

41
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:13,965
you do a control click on it and
go to Properties.

42
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:19,650
There you click on Login.

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,540
So we are in the Codename One menu.

44
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,260
You click on Login and
you put the email and

45
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,010
password that you used on the website,
so please do that.

46
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,635
Let me do that again.

47
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:38,677
[SOUND]
And then

48
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:43,719
don't forget

49
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,340
to click on OK

50
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,968
to confirm.

51
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,730
Okay, that's good.

52
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,840
Now what we need is another ingredient.

53
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,947
We need you to actually get your Apple ID.

54
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:06,730
So if you are on a Mac computer and

55
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,695
if you have an iPhone I mean,
you have to have an Apple ID.

56
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:15,390
That's part of the Apple system.

57
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,460
So I assume you have one.

58
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,160
If you don't, just create one.

59
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,880
It's just, you just Google create
Apple ID, and you will get one.

60
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,070
With your Apple ID, you will enroll
in the Apple Developer Program.

61
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,470
So that's what I just Googled,
Apple Developer Program, and

62
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,230
that's the first result
that you get in Google.

63
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:48,760
So you click there, Apple Developer
Program, and then you will need to enroll.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:56,868
You can't put an app on your phone if you
don't belong to the app developer program.

65
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:58,772
It will cost you $99.

66
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,049
That's the bad news.

67
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,871
But that's the same for everybody.

68
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:06,986
It's $99 per year and with this fee,

69
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:12,580
you can create as many apps
as you want for Apple.

70
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,640
So, you click on enroll as I just did.

71
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,590
Then start your enrollment.

72
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:22,885
And this is where you
will need your Apple ID.

73
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:28,315
So I'll let you complete this step,
get your credit card ready,

74
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:29,955
and enroll as an individual.

75
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:36,275
Except if you're a company but
I would assume, maybe you're a company.

76
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:40,705
But if you're an individual please
choose the individual enrollment.

77
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,280
That should be it.

78
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,830
Okay, so you are,
you have an Apple Developer account.

79
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,620
That's good.

80
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,280
What else do you need?

81
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,530
Oh yeah, then you need to
connect your phone to iTunes.

82
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,080
So I assume you have iTunes
installed on you Mac.

83
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,910
If it's not the case, please install it.

84
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,370
So I had iTunes already open here, so

85
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,900
this is iTunes, and as you see, my phone

86
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,650
is recognized there because I plugged
my phone with the cable to the Mac.

87
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,840
So if you click on your phone,
you have a lot of information.

88
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,980
What you will need is to
click on the cellular number

89
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,470
cuz when you click on
it the UD ID appears.

90
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,840
So that's what we will need
in a couple of seconds.

91
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,280
If you made a mistake and clicked twice or

92
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,140
you see that, just click again and again
and again and it returns to the UD ID.

93
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,758
So stay there.

94
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:57,815
Okay.

95
00:06:57,815 --> 00:07:06,917
How do I I want to make you here.

96
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:12,317
So we have all of that and

97
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:17,270
if I'm not wrong.

98
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,220
Yes, we're good to go.

99
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,310
So now we will actually create the App.

100
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,010
So we get back to NetBeans.

101
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:33,730
We do a control click on the title of
the project and we go to Properties.

102
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,216
There we click on IOS,
just on the left here.

103
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:51,510
And here we will create the certificate
from Apple for our app.

104
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,707
Usually this is a very heavy and
difficult and painful process but

105
00:07:56,707 --> 00:08:02,470
we are very lucky to have something
which will guide is through.

106
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,430
Just click on Generate.

107
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:12,391
This is where you will put
your Apple Developer ID.

108
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:19,250
So that should be, I assume it
to be the same as your Apple ID.

109
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,530
In case of that, that's the log in you
used for your Apple Developer program.

110
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,930
When you enroll and

111
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,910
you pay this $99.

112
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,887
[SOUND]
And

113
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:43,861
you log in.

114
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:51,450
So I agreed.

115
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:53,790
ITunes connect.

116
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,080
Not Apple Developer Program log in.

117
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,780
But I think these two
things are synonymous.

118
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,523
If you see that, as I just have here,
I think it's a bug, and

119
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:07,873
you just have to repeat
exactly as you did.

120
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:16,257
Maybe you retype your password to make
sure you didn't make any mistake and

121
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:18,781
it should work the second time.

122
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:23,996
Maybe this bug will be corrected
by the time you see this tutorial.

123
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:33,848
Yes, so that was indeed just a bug.

124
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:41,650
So now Apple asks us
to register our phone.

125
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,385
Because they want, other wants to know
which phone you are going to use.

126
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:57,879
So we click on Add A Device, Add A Phone,
give it whatever name you want.

127
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,790
I call it My iPhone 4.

128
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,280
And they want a UDID.

129
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,140
That's exactly what you have in iTunes.

130
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,610
Switch to the iTunes window and here, and

131
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,510
if you click on it,
that's just going to hide it.

132
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:23,770
So go back to your UDID and if I'm not
mistaken, you do a control click on it.

133
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,590
Yes.

134
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,960
So you type on,
you keep the control pressed.

135
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,720
And you click, and
then you see copy, so click on copy.

136
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,213
You can go back to NetBeans,
and there you click on

137
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:43,270
Ctrl+V or Cmd+Ctrl+V.

138
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,190
Did it work?

139
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,578
No.
Cmd+V, and the UDID gets pasted

140
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:54,793
under window and you click on Add.

141
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,280
Yes, your phone is now registered.

142
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,530
It means now you can install apps on it.

143
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,420
So you select your phone and
you click on Next.

144
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:23,233
Because I did the steps already it tells
me that I already have some certificate,

145
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:26,660
but in your case,
that should be your first.

146
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,450
So you should not have this warning.

147
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,840
In any case just click
on Yes if you have that.

148
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:39,710
And we'll have the same, we'll have
the same warning for something else.

149
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,220
We, frankly don't care about that,
but that, just click on yes.

150
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,309
We're nearly there.

151
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:58,823
Yes, so, Nedbeans and
Codename One very nicely created these

152
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:04,179
two certificates that we need to
put our app onto our iPhone and

153
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:11,700
even this certificate that you see here,
to distribute our app on the app store.

154
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,260
I want to insist that's
usually a huge pain and

155
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,560
you have a lot of long
tutorials to do all that.

156
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,380
And you obtain that in less than 12
minutes if you're still there, so

157
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,190
it's really very nice reserved.

158
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,280
We just have to click on Next, there.

159
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,660
And it will ask us to

160
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,620
download these two certificates,
I think, or maybe not even.

161
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,450
Oh yes.

162
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,550
It asks us to install or
just to save these two files,

163
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,780
these two certificates onto your Mac,
so just click there.

164
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,330
And they ask us where
should I save these things?

165
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:06,580
I would recommend you to save these
two files in the folder of your app.

166
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,680
So this folder is in NetBeansProjects,
double-click on it.

167
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,590
And this is my app here.

168
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,241
So we'll just double-click there.

169
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:23,691
And just double-clicking
just save this to there.

170
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:24,922
So I can close.

171
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:32,591
And as you see from all these lines that
were empty a couple of minutes ago and

172
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:36,740
the software just added these things for
us.

173
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,180
So we just have to click on OK now and

174
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,330
ready to put an app on our iPhone,
there is no issue now.

175
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,460
So, let's do that.

176
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,310
We are almost finished.

177
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,240
You again do a control click
on the title of the project.

178
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,910
And this time you don't go to the bottom,
you go to cut then one.

179
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,290
And you click on Send IOS Debug Build.

180
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,580
So why not App Store?

181
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,360
Because you don't want to send the App
to the App Store, you want to install it

182
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,180
on your phone, so just click there.

183
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,200
And we will see a lot of activities there,

184
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,230
it means that NetBeans
that we're using here

185
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,960
is creating an iPhone
version of our app and

186
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,380
it's sending it to Codename One,
the web site where we were before.

187
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,750
So we just have to go to the Codename One
web site now, which is there.

188
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,640
You have to log in.

189
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,459
Maybe just like me your username and
password was saved.

190
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,400
So, right click on log in.

191
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,390
And here you click on dashboard.

192
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:18,350
There's an announcement but we don't care.

193
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,790
And you see that indeed something with,
I mean,

194
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,180
the app we had in has arrived
on the website here and

195
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,920
they're saying we should wait cuz
the build is still in progress.

196
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,470
So we'll wait.

197
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,456
While the build finishes,

198
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:44,454
I think my Mac, my iPhone, sorry.

199
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:48,755
I should connect it with the Wi-Fi,
because I don't have a data plan.

200
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:56,002
I don't have a data plan, so
I should connect the wi-fi now.

201
00:15:56,002 --> 00:16:02,492
So, Is the Wi-Fi the enabled?

202
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,330
Yes it seems so.

203
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,260
Sorry.
I was just making sure the Wi-Fi is

204
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:22,590
enabled on my phone because we were
netted in a second with the QR code app.

205
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,910
So yes, from blue return to green,
which means it's finished,

206
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,220
you can click on it, and
there is this QR code, here.

207
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,340
With the app that I mentioned at the very
beginning of this tutorial, you see this

208
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:45,320
oops, oops, this app here in the focus.

209
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,456
It doesn't focus.

210
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:52,770
[INAUDIBLE]
No, not quite.

211
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,580
Anyway, with this app I will
just launch it, open it.

212
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,141
So it looks like that.

213
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:09,026
And I will and, I will just scan the bar
code that you see on the screen.

214
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:14,007
That's all, that's what I do now [SOUND].

215
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:18,960
And the sound that you heard.

216
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,192
Means that the bar code was scanned.

217
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:28,680
And I'm invited to install the app,
so I click on it.

218
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,497
You see a warning of some sort,

219
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:38,224
so 'yes' install.

220
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,800
And we see the app arriving here.

221
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,888
It says waiting.

222
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,850
I wish the focus was better.

223
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,582
It means loading.

224
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:54,125
It's loading.

225
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:12,240
And the app is now installed.

226
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,970
You see that the logo is
the default logo by Codename One.

227
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,900
If you wish to have another one
we'll see in another tutorial how to

228
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,830
use your own picture for a logo.

229
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:31,500
And let me open the app so that you see
that it's actually the app we had in here.

230
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,850
And let me switch on screen.

231
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,270
So you see here that's
the app that we had.

232
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,690
And that's the app we have here.

233
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,843
So it's an empty,
not very exciting app, but

234
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:51,933
we do have our first app on an iPhone and
that's great.

235
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:56,519
Thank you for this tutorial and
see you in the next two bit great apps.

236
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,120
Bye.
