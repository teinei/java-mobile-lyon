00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,770
Hi, welcome to this video
where we learn how to

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,130
put an app on the iOS App Store,
so for Apple phones.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,230
In order to do that you should
have followed the tutorial that

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,480
explains how you should test
your app on your own iPhone.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,310
Because when we did that, when we did
this tutorial, we created a certificates

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,290
that we need to put
the app on the app store.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,760
So you should have followed the tutorial,
and if you remember

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,350
the tutorial it's all about following
wizard where certificates are created.

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,290
When you have done that you are ready
to create a version of your app

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,150
to distribute it for Apple Stores.

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,815
So you have done that,
you have created the certificates,

12
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:06,120
and now you select in NetBeans
the name of your project.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,288
And you right-click on it.

14
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:16,190
So these steps, I should say,
should be done from a Mac computer.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,500
So if you're watching this from a PC,
you're gonna be able to

16
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,250
create your app in upper version.

17
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,255
So you can do the following steps, but

18
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:35,185
you will be blocked at the later step when
we gonna upload this app to the store.

19
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:40,406
So maybe you can follow on a PC, but for
the last step you should find a friend

20
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:50,777
or relative that would lend you an upper
MAC in order to approach the app.

21
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,230
But for the moment, everybody can follow.

22
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:59,797
So you right-click, or
on a Mac you do Ctrl+click,

23
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:04,005
on the name of your project, and
then you select Codename One.

24
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:07,029
The menu and

25
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:11,870
then send the iOS.

26
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,330
If you see that,
it means that you did not yet

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,220
follow the wizard where
the set's are being created.

28
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,402
If this is greyed out as
it is the case for me here,

29
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:31,594
it means your app has no certificate for
the app.

30
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:36,010
I'm gonna create the certificates for

31
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,169
this app, and I'm going back here.

32
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:45,019
And it literally took me
less than two minutes to

33
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,405
create this, such the case that I needed.

34
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:53,845
I simply right-click on the project,
clicked on Properties here.

35
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,240
And then, I moved to iOS here on the left.

36
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,770
And then, I clicked on Generate and
followed the steps.

37
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,820
What I just needed was
the name of my account

38
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,720
on iTunes Connect, and my password,
and then I just follow the steps until

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,210
my certificates were generated.

40
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,320
And then, what you see on screen here,

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,828
was filled in by the wizard,
by this thing here, automatically.

42
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:31,720
So that was very easy, and again that's
one of the strengths of this tool.

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,610
It does it for you.

44
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,680
You don't have to struggle.

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,280
And now, I can right-click again,

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,800
set a Codename One, and
then this option becomes available.

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,430
So I'm gonna click on it just to show you.

48
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,070
I've actually created a version
of this app in advance.

49
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:01,510
But I'm gonna do it again with you.

50
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,700
So basically,

51
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,200
what happens now is that your app in
the Apple version is being created.

52
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:15,656
And the way it works is what
you did in NetBeans is sent to

53
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,740
the Codename One website.

54
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:24,840
And then, [BLANK AUDIO] you can
login to the Codename One website,

55
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,500
and find your app ready to be distributed.

56
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,059
So you have to log into Codename One,
click on dashboard,

57
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:39,869
[BLANK AUDIO] and
here you see you have apps.

58
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:47,945
[BLANK AUDIO] That's the one which
is being built at the moment.

59
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:53,160
I'm gonna post the video,
because Apple apps can take.

60
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,285
Let's see the previous one I've built.

61
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:04,590
We don't see a upload versions there,
but I know it takes a couple of minutes.

62
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,760
So I'm gonna pause and
come back here in a minute.

63
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,190
And the app is still being built,
but I'd like to add a comment here.

64
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,344
So when you are on a free
version of Codename One,

65
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:19,080
you have 100 credits per month,

66
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,530
which means that each time you send an
Android build, it's 1 credit being used.

67
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,360
And you've 100 of them.

68
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,120
For iOS, when you send or
when you create, when you build

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,100
an iOS version of your app, or
a Windows final version of your app,

70
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,010
it takes more credits each
time you do one build.

71
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,240
I don't have the figures exactly, but I
think it's like seven or eight credits for

72
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,504
each iOS build, you do.

73
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:54,060
So that means that after

74
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,380
about 15 builds you have exhausted
your credits for the month.

75
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,520
So you should be very careful not to
send too many builds of your iOS app.

76
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,304
You should actually test
your app as much as you can,

77
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:19,680
on the simulator on your computer,
before sending the iOS build.

78
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,397
So I pause again the video and compile.

79
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:24,959
Welcome back.
So it took 4 minutes and

80
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,625
30 seconds to build the app
in the iOS version, and

81
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:36,430
when we click on this build, we see that
a couple of files have been created.

82
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,245
So this is the application in itself,
and we can download it.

83
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:49,482
[BLANK AUDIO] Let's

84
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:54,460
put it on the desktop.

85
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,794
So the name is very complicated, but
it should have an IPA extension.

86
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:08,100
[BLANK AUDIO] And we can download iTunes.

87
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:17,160
So this is the icon of your app.

88
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,897
How do I save this?

89
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:33,870
Yeah, I'm gonna save it on the desktop,
as well.

90
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,610
And this icon is useful, because you're
gonna use it when submitting your app.

91
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,235
So let's check the extension,
it's a file that

92
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:51,054
ends up with iTunesArtwork but
its a PNG file.

93
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:57,497
So you could actually
immediately add .png, and Save.

94
00:07:57,497 --> 00:08:04,090
So I have these two files and
that should be enough on my desktop.

95
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,530
So we have our app and
we want to distribute it.

96
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,950
So in Google, let's go back to Google
as if you see where starting from here.

97
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:22,440
You will just type itunesconnect
in one word and apple.

98
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,650
And when you do that you
find the URL that we need.

99
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,508
And you should login
with your Apple Developer

100
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:39,492
account that you created before.

101
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:45,270
From previous tutorials, we had to pay
$99 to actually get such an account.

102
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,820
And there, what I've already an app here,
but I'm gonna create a second one.

103
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,280
So you want to create a new iOS App?

104
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,710
It's not for computers,
it's for mobile phones.

105
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,388
So you give it a name and the name should

106
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:06,782
be exactly the one from your NetBeans

107
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:12,186
project, so I'm gonna copy paste.

108
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,460
You see what I just did.

109
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,070
I right-clicked on it and did Properties.

110
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,813
And that's how I find the name of my app.

111
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,060
So that's the name I put here.

112
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,290
Version, you can put as
the first version of your app,

113
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,350
so Primary Language would be English.

114
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:44,810
And the Bundle ID is the one here.

115
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,860
You should have the Bundle ID of
your app available in this menu,

116
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,260
because we created a certificate for
your app.

117
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,761
And when you create a certificate,
it puts the Bundle ID,

118
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,406
so the package name actually of your app
here, the package name that we have to

119
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:04,050
fill in at the beginning
when you create a project.

120
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:10,960
When you create the for your app, it saves
your package name on iTunes Connect.

121
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,823
So you can just select it from the list.

122
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:19,810
So you do that, and
we are ready to create the app.

123
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,088
What's missing here?

124
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,987
Why is it complaining?

125
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:29,911
So what's the SKU, [INAUDIBLE].

126
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:34,995
Oh yeah, it wants a unique ID,

127
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:40,673
so I'm gonna write io.codapps.

128
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,353
I'm gonna use the same as the vendor ID.

129
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:52,290
Io.codapps.mymobilecv here,

130
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:59,381
and then you can create it.

131
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:11,760
So here you have much information to
fill in and nothing very difficult.

132
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,321
Most of it is optional, so
you don't have to fit in everything, but

133
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:26,010
if you forgot to fill in
a field in this form,

134
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,320
when you're gonna save your form,
it will highlight in red,

135
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
the fields that you should fill in.

136
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,359
So among all of these things I
would like to highlight how do

137
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:51,026
you upload the file we got from Codename
One to the iTunes Connect website to here?

138
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:52,420
This is here.

139
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,760
There is a fill that says build.

140
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,082
And say submit your build using Xcode.

141
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:00,540
So Xcode is a software and
we didn't use it.

142
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,010
Or this.

143
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,181
And that's what we're gonna use.

144
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:12,324
So click on application loader,
[BLANK AUDIO] and

145
00:12:12,324 --> 00:12:17,784
this will install a software
on your laptop that

146
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:23,380
will just upload the file
at two iTunes Connect,

147
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,762
and this step can only be done on a MAC.

148
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:30,495
If you have a PC here
that's not gonna work.

149
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:41,343
So I save what they called Application
Loader, oh that's a huge file actually.

150
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:56,431
I'm nearly there, and we dock,

151
00:12:56,431 --> 00:13:01,309
so I'm gonna restore it now.

152
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,050
It's restoring.

153
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:07,928
And we have it here.

154
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:12,135
So I click on it.

155
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:21,260
So that's what we want.

156
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,300
A tool that helps you add
applications to the app store.

157
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,060
That's what we want.

158
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,382
Next, Install.

159
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,998
So you need to have, what's the name of,

160
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:46,396
I hope it's here,
that's the correct password.

161
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,255
Nearly there.

162
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,021
[SOUND] Finishing.

163
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:00,840
Successful.

164
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,360
So we should have this app available.

165
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,994
I'm not MAC user but
that's where you should have it,

166
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,650
Application Loader in
your application list.

167
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,010
So we launch it.

168
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,900
Accept.

169
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,998
And this is where, again,
that's a long process, but that's how you

170
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:47,357
And that's it.

171
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:52,100
We just [BLANK AUDIO] choose.

172
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,570
We just input the file that we
had downloaded to the desktop.

173
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,575
With the extension IPA.

174
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,761
Where is that?

175
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,602
It's here.

176
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:23,592
Yeah here.

177
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:30,281
So, yeah, I had to select Choose,
not Import.

178
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,815
So we're good, next.

179
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:51,994
If it takes too long I'm
gonna pause the video here.

180
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,703
Yeah, I'm gonna pause the video.

181
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:10,663
And I meet you here when
we go to the next step.

182
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:15,771
The process is going on, and
we hit this window that suggests

183
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:20,993
that we should choose install to continue,
so I just do that.

184
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:32,583
And this will install a very small
software, again, on your Mac.

185
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:38,123
So you do that just once, right.

186
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:42,150
It's not for every app you create.

187
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,220
That's just, you do that the first time.

188
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,130
I'm going to pause the video again.

189
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:57,176
Software finished installing,
and we're back

190
00:16:57,176 --> 00:17:04,188
to this screen where our app is being
uploaded to the iTunes store and

191
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:08,630
we're gonna wait for the thing to finish.

192
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm pausing the video again.

193
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,580
So I was stuck on this page for a very
long time, and that seemed to be a bug.

194
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,933
So I Googled for an answer, and
it seems that the reason might be

195
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:32,003
that I was doing this uploading from my
business school where there's a firewall,

196
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:36,660
these things that can
control internet connections.

197
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,741
So that might be the reason
why I was stuck, and

198
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:44,090
I am trying now to do it from
a different place without a firewall.

199
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:51,261
So I just restart,
I select the file of my app,

200
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:55,871
and I just restart the process, and

201
00:17:55,871 --> 00:18:01,420
let's hope we won't get stuck this time.

202
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,220
Okay, so this is exactly
where I was stuck last time.

203
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,550
Let's hope things get a bit different.

204
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm going to pause the video,
and I'll let you know.

205
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,450
Yeah, that was the issue.

206
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,920
I'll just pass the step, and
my file has has just been uploaded.

207
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,290
So this warning is just
an informational message.

208
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,340
I think it doesn't block anything but
just to come back.

209
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,617
The reason why I was stuck for so
long on the very fine package,

210
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:47,080
whatever it is,
because I was behind a firewall.

211
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:54,219
So you should upload your app
from a place like your home or

212
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:58,978
from a place where the IT department of

213
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:03,160
the place has not put a firewall.

214
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,980
So, typically, companies have firewalls.

215
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,830
So try to do that from home.

216
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,440
Okay, so, thank you very much.

217
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,345
And, we'll just move back to

218
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:24,204
the iTunes Connect account to verify

219
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:29,500
that the app has been added here.

220
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,171
And if we go to pre-release, yes,

221
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:45,120
we have our app which is ready to be used.

222
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,000
So when you have that,
what you should do is simply

223
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:56,130
fill in the key words here.

224
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,408
Add the Support URL, so
I will just add people who

225
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:07,980
would like to contact me
would just go to my website.

226
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,328
If you don't have a website, well,

227
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:16,080
you could use the website
of an organization that you

228
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,220
are affiliated to If you don't,
that might be an issue.

229
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,680
I suggest you Google for
an answer, because

230
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,500
that must be the case that
individuals without a website or

231
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,860
URL Must have faced this issue.

232
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,483
And this is where you should put
the description of your apps,

233
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:46,030
the one that will appear on the store.

234
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,219
So, this is the app of presenting my CV,

235
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:57,030
and you should get a bit longer than that.

236
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,553
So what is very specific
to the iOS store or

237
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:09,450
the iTunes store is that Apple is very
strict on the quality of your apps.

238
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,730
So, you should really make
sure that you are filling

239
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:20,130
all possible categories
before submitting the app.

240
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,242
Then, you will face a delay of a time,

241
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:29,387
of couple of weeks,
it depends for everybody,

242
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:34,274
but like one week to
several weeks in order for

243
00:21:34,274 --> 00:21:38,410
you to actually appear on this store.

244
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:45,080
So it's a bit disappointing, but
your app will end up on this store.

245
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,660
That's how I've just shown
you this step to do it.

246
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,490
So I'll stop there, and
If I can go back to that.

247
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,940
Pause the recorder.

248
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,580
I stop there, and thank you.
